# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver

## Overview

This Java project explores the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and evaluates the performance of three algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Neighbor First Last, and Node Insertion. The project provides a set of classes designed to handle basic functions, graphs, node (cities) management, individual solvers for each algorithm, and an overarching TSP solver.

## Project Structure

- **`src`**: Contains the source code files.
  - **`BasicFunctions.java`**: Implements basic utility functions (i.e. input).
  - **`Graphs.java`**: Manages the graph representation.
  - **`Node.java`**: Represents cities as nodes.
  - **`NNSolver.java`**: Implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
  - **`NNFLSolver.java`**: Implements the Nearest Neighbor First Last algorithm.
  - **`NISolver.java`**: Implements the Node Insertion algorithm.
  - **`TSPSolver.java`**: Parent class for the three solvers.
  - **`Main.java`**: Entry point for the application.
  - **`Stats.java`**: Collects and analyzes performance statistics.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
